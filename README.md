A command-line interface (CLI) Chess game built in Java where a human player (White) competes against a Gemini AI model (Black). The game includes basic chess move validation, AI move generation via the Gemini API, and an in-game chat feature.

## Features

* **CLI Gameplay:** Play chess directly in your terminal.
* **Gemini AI Opponent:** Black's moves are generated by Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model.
* **Move Validation:** Implements rules for piece movement (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King) and basic capture logic.
* **AI Retries:** The AI will attempt to suggest a different move if its initial suggestion is invalid (up to a set limit).
* **Check Detection:** The game detects and announces when a King is in check.
* **Basic Game End Detection:** Detects checkmate/stalemate based on the current (simplified) legal move generation.
* **Chat Feature:** Type non-move commands during your turn to chat with the Gemini AI.

## Requirements

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher recommended.
* **Google Gemini API Key:** You need an API key to interact with the Gemini model. Obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

## Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lalomorales22/Chess-CLI-GeminiPro.git
    cd Chess-CLI-GeminiPro
    ```
2.  **Verify JAR:** The required `org.json-1.6-20240205.jar` library is included in the repository. Ensure it's present in the main directory alongside `CliChessGame.java`.

## Compilation

Open your terminal in the project directory (where `CliChessGame.java` and `org.json-1.6-20240205.jar` are located) and run the following command:

* **Linux/macOS:**
    ```bash
    javac -cp ".:org.json-1.6-20240205.jar" CliChessGame.java
    ```
* **Windows:**
    ```bash
    javac -cp ".;org.json-1.6-20240205.jar" CliChessGame.java
    ```

## Running the Game

Make sure you are still in the project directory in your terminal. Run the following command:

* **Linux/macOS:**
    ```bash
    java -cp ".:org.json-1.6-20240205.jar" CliChessGame
    ```
* **Windows:**
    ```bash
    java -cp ".;org.json-1.6-20240205.jar" CliChessGame
    ```

You will be prompted to enter your Gemini API Key. If you are running in a standard terminal, the input should be masked for security.

## Gameplay

* The board will be displayed. White (you) moves first.
* Enter moves using standard algebraic notation (e.g., `e2e4`, `g1 f3`, `e2 e4`). Spaces between the start and end squares are optional.
* If you enter text that is not a valid move format during your turn, it will be sent as a chat message to the AI.
* The AI (Black) will analyze the board and suggest its move. The game includes internal validation, so illegal AI moves should be caught.
* The game will announce if a King is in check and will end upon detecting checkmate or stalemate (based on current logic).
* Type `quit` at any time during your turn to exit the game.

## Current Limitations & TODO

* **Legal Move Generation:** The `getAllLegalMoves` function is currently a stub. It does not fully filter out moves that would leave the player's own King in check. This impacts the accuracy of checkmate and stalemate detection. Implementing this fully is the next major step.
* **Cannot Move Into Check:** Basic checks are in place to prevent a player from making a move that *immediately* leaves their King in check, but this relies on the `isKingInCheck` function and doesn't use the full legal move generation.
* **Special Moves:** Castling, En Passant, and Pawn Promotion are not yet implemented.
* **Draw Conditions:** Only Stalemate is detected. Other draw conditions (threefold repetition, 50-move rule, insufficient material) are not implemented.
* **AI Strategy:** The AI's strategy is based on the Gemini model's current capabilities and the prompt provided. It may not always play optimally or consistently.
